
Welcome to the Mercury Nihombashi *Doujinshi* support repository
------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for browsing this repository. I suppose that you purchased (at least, one of) my *doujinshis* (fanzines) with the name Kasumi YOSHINO at the *doujinshi* sales exhibition (Comic Market and TechBookFest, for example). Supplementary contents (e.g. errata, source codes, figures, movies and so on) will be uploaded here when they are available. Please open the folder (directory) named "Xyy-*abbreviation of the name of doujinshi*", where X denotes type of the exhibition and yy is the total number of exhibitions held (e.g. "C91-relaysound").
