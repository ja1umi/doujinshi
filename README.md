Welcome to the Mercury Nihombashi *Doujinshi* support repository
------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for browsing this repository because you purchased (at least, one of) my *doujinshi* (fanzine) at the Comic Market.  Supplementary contents (e.g. errata, source codes, figures, movies and so on) will be uploaded here when they are available. Please open the folder (directory) named "Cxx-*abbreviation of the name of doujinshis*", where xx is the total number of times of the Comic Market ("C91-relaysound", for example).
