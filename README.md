
Welcome to the Mercury Nihombashi *Doujinshi* support repository
------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for browsing this repository. I suppose that you purchased (at least, one of) my *doujinshis* (fanzines) with the name Kasumi YOSHINO at the Comic Market.  Supplementary contents (e.g. errata, source codes, figures, movies and so on) will be uploaded here when they are available. Please open the folder (directory) named "Cxx-*abbreviation of the name of doujinshi*", where xx is the total number of times  Comic Market was held (e.g. "C91-relaysound").
